# Excellence_path
This repository contains my  code of work realized for the Excellence Path, during the a.a.2020/2021 at Sapienza, University od Rome.
I have built a new multi-tier domain according to the theoretical framework described in the paper.

The folders are divided as follows:

-labelled_version: contains labelled domain and problem.\
-multi-tier_version: contains multi-tier domain and multi-tier problem.\
-d2_model: contains the domain and problem related to planning domain 2.\
-d1_model: contains the domain and problem related to planning domain 1.\
-d2_temporal_goals: contains the domain and problem related to planning domain 2 with the temporal goals obtained with [FOND4LTLfPLTLf](https://github.com/whitemech/FOND4LTLf).

-d1_temporal_goals: contains the domain and problem related to planning domain 1 with the temporal goals obtained with FOND4.
-Multi_tier_temp_goals: contains the final multi-tier version of domain and problem with temporal goals.
