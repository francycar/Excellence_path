# Excellence_path
This repository contains my  code of work realized for the Excellence Path, during the a.a.2020/2021 at Sapienza, University od Rome.
I have built a new multi-tier domain according to the theoretical framework described in the paper [Multi-Tier Automated Planning for Adaptive Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12445).

The folders are divided as follows:

-labelled_version: contains labelled domain and problem.\

-multi-tier_version: contains multi-tier domain and multi-tier problem.\

-d2_model: contains the domain and problem related to planning domain 2.\

-d1_model: contains the domain and problem related to planning domain 1.\

-d2_temporal_goals: contains the domain and problem related to planning domain 2 with the temporal goals obtained with [FOND4LTLfPLTLf](https://github.com/whitemech/FOND4LTLf).

-d1_temporal_goals: contains the domain and problem related to planning domain 1 with the temporal goals obtained with FOND4.

-Multi_tier_temp_goals: contains the final multi-tier version of domain and problem with temporal goals.

-newpypddl: contains the new version of pypddl-translator, in order to take as input multiple separated domains and multiple separated problems.


Tools used for the realization:

-[pypddl-translator](https://github.com/ssardina-planning/pypddl-translator).

-[FOND4LTLfPLTLf](https://github.com/whitemech/FOND4LTLf).

-A new implemented version of pypddl-translator, see folder **newpypddl**.
